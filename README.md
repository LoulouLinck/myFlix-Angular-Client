<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## ðŸ’» Getting Started 

<br>
`npm install -g @angular/cli@16.2.10`
<br>
Run ng new app-name to create a new app.
Run ng generate component component-name to generate a new component.
<br>
Run `ng serve --open` to prompt Angular build the project and navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
<br>
Open src/app/app.module.ts and add import { HttpClientModule } from '@angular/common/http';. The HttpClientModule is a simplified API for Angular applications that makes it possible for the client app to communicate with the API or server-side. After the import, add HttpClientModule in the @NgModule imports.
